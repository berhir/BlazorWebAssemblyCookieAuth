# About this project

In January 2019, Dominick Baier (known for his work on [IdentityServer](https://github.com/IdentityServer)) published an article about "[An alternative way to secure SPAs (with ASP.NET Core, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0 and ProxyKit)](https://leastprivilege.com/2019/01/18/an-alternative-way-to-secure-spas-with-asp-net-core-openid-connect-oauth-2-0-and-proxykit/)".

This is a sample implementation with a Blazor WebAssembly SPA as front-end.

You can find more details in my blog post "[Secure a Blazor WebAssembly application with cookie authentication](https://guidnew.com/en/blog/secure-a-blazor-webassembly-application-with-cookie-authentication/)".


Updated to work with NET 7 and new demo server.
